"""
Airline connectors package — 73 production-grade airline integrations.

Path shim: connector source files use bare imports like ``from connectors.X``
and ``from models.X`` (shared with the standalone top-level directory).
We add the ``letsfg/`` package root to sys.path so those imports
resolve to the copies shipped inside this package.
